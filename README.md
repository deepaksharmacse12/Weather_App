# Weather-App
Weather web applications 
------------------------
Web App using MVC.NET framework, Bing Maps API for getting the location of places, and openweather map API for getting the weather forecast.
In the WeatherWidget.js file present in (~/MvcApplication1/Sripts/Internal), you need to provide the credentials on line 24 for the request to using bing maps (more details: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx).
Application uses JQuery, JS, CSS, xHtml.
I have designed App controller, build the project and go to App sub-directory.
